			<h2>If you're having issues deploying to your link do/check these:</h2>
			<h3> - Update the HTML page w/ the port listed for your group on the MUWB doc (this page needs the Websocket
				Port)</h3>
			<h3> - Update the App class (the Websocket port should match the HTML doc & the HTTP port also needs to be
				corrected) </h3>
			<h3> - The script for your group & proj1.service need to be updated to reflect your main App class</h3>

			<h4>Doing this & running to the given bash script as given in the module should let you deploy your game to
				the server and map it to your group's hyperlink <br>
				Note that you will need to type your group number @ the end of the bash script terminal command (i.e.
				bash scripts/deploy.bash group#) <br>
